Create a Pythonprogram that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
<br/>If the user enters '8' the output should be:
<br/>1
<br/>2
<br/>4
<br/>8
<br/>sum: 15
